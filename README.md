A website for nerd to upload their take on pop culture and videogame recipes.

## User Story

As a member of the nerd community I want a webpage where I can enter in a contest to win best recipe of the week So that myself and other nerds can battle for recipe supremacy.

## Description

Upon starting the application the user must login with a username and password or they must create an account if they do not have one already. Once the user is logged in they are taken to their home page where they can browse recipes by theme name for inspiration and view recipes other users have submitted. The homepage will display the winner of the recipe of the week. Users may choose to enter their own customized recipe for chances to win the contest. To submit a recipe, users must enter the recipe name, ingredients, instructions, upload a picture of the finished meal and select the theme for that recipe. Users will be able to track the contest on the webpage through the countdown implemented in this application. Once the countdown is finished the winning recipe will be announced and displayed on the homepage for all users to see.
